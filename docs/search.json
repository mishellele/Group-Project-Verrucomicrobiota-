    "text": "Verrucomicrobia are present in almost all soil, but it was originally thought to be at low frequencies since there were only a few studies that focused on the verrucomicrobia quantities. However, with ecological data from The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), funded by the National Science Foundation, more data has surfaced, providing information about the bacteria across ecosystems, with data focusing on Niwot Ridge, Colorado. With the increasing temperatures due to global warming, it is important to take notice of the different bacteria that are growing and changing along with the climate. Where they require very specific environments to grow, taking notice of the different features of existing environments is massively important. In the near future where climates might not be able to keep the bacteria alive, it would be vital to provide a possible man made environment that can facilitate the bacteria growth with the data collected, allowing for a deeper understanding of the bacteria. \n\nMotivating Reasons\nBacteria play many important roles in the soil of ecosystem such as providing soil structure, soil aggregation, recycling of soil nutrients, and water recycling. They also serve an important function in breaking down organic residues, carbon compounds and simple sugars, as well as taking up nutrients into their cell membranes such as nitrogen  (Hoorman, 2016). These functions are important for plant growth and maintaining a healthy ecosystem, i.e. continuous recycling of nutrients, maintaining a balance of pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacterial species, and soil stability. The phylum of bacteria Verrucromicrobiota are widespread and while the research surrounding their functions is limited it is thought that they play a major role in carbon degeneration and have a greater ability to survive in a variety of conditions than previously thought. Just like other bacteria, Verrucromicrobiota must be able to adapt to the diverse microenvironments of the soil in order to provide these ecological benefits, and with increasing global temperatures that generally raise microbial activity and in turn decrease the amount of organic matter in soil (Ruan, 2023) it will be important to monitor their abundance in different ecosystems across time.\n\n\nIntroduction\nThe National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) funded by the National Science Foundation is a large, continental-scale project with the purpose of collecting long-term open access ecological data at various sites throughout the United States including Hawaii and Puerto Rico. This data enables researchers to conduct studies addressing questions related to important environmental challenges. The NEON database includes information on freshwater ecosystems such as rivers and streams as well as terrestrial ecosystems ranging from mountainous tundra to tropical rainforests. We are particularly interested in the microbe metagenome sequence data that NEON has collected which includes metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of various phylums and orders of bacteria at different sites across the United States. For our specific project, we focus on the NEON project site located in the Niwot Ridge in Boulder, Colorado (NIWO), and the bacteria Verrucromicorbiota. In our study, we are using NEON data from the NIWO site to explore the relationship between Verrucormicriobiota abundance and soil conditions, and we explore how this relationship impacts Verrucomicrobiota growth and what this could mean for the ecosystems the bacteria inhabits.\nVerrucomicrobia is a free living, widespread phylum of bacteria surviving in freshwater, marine, terrestrial soil, and animal gut, and are significant contributors to carbon cycling. Despite their prevalence, they are underrepresented in databases, limiting our understanding of their ecological roles. Recent findings highlight Verrucomicrobia’s role as specialist organic polymer degraders capable of adapting to diverse environmental conditions, expanding our understanding of their ecological significance (Nixon, 2019). \n\nVerrucomicrobiota\n\nFree living bacteria (not dependent on other organisms for survival)\nCan survive in a variety of ecosystems: freshwater, marine, terrestrial soil, animal gut \nMetagenome analysis suggests “potential role as polysaccharide degraders in freshwater” [Fuerst, 2019]\naverage 23% of all bacterial sequences present in the microbial communities (Bergmann et al., 2011)\nThis bacteria has possible associations with \nBacteria found in mucus lining of guts, high abundance in adults, aids in glucose homeostasis\nAssociated with the algae bloom onset"

    "text": "Environmental Data\nWe found that, overall, Verrucomicrobiota is a phylum that is found under many different environmental conditions. There were wide spreads of distribution across soil temperature and pH, but the most common conditions were temperatures between 10 and 20 degrees celsius and pH values between 6 and 7. This observation mirrors that of the overall studied MAGs. Verrucomicrobiota were found in 6 different ecosystem subtypes, and these locations were well-distributed throughout their phylogeny. Interestingly, for soil nutrients Verrucomicrobiota tended to be at the high and low ends, but not the middle, of the spectra for both nitrogen and organic carbon amounts, but both of these observations may have been influenced by sample size. Finally, the phylum was found at a variety of different depths, but the most common by far was 0.10 meters (although this is also likely influenced by the types of sampling). Overall, this would imply that Verrucomicrobiota is able to adapt to many different environments, perhaps meaning that they could resist environmental changes.\nWe also expanded our study of environmental data into different sites, focusing on Niwot Ridge but also examining the other NEON sites due to a lack of data available for Niwot. We found correlations between soil temperature and elevation at Niwot Ridge but not for all sites, as well as a weak one between soil temperature and pH over all NEON sites. The different ecosystem subtypes had different average temperatures which was to be expected. Niwot Ridge was determined to be fully Terrestrial Soil, with a fairly even split between mineral and organic soil samples and a variety of elevations.\n\n\nGenome and Assembly Data\nIn addition to environmental factors we looked into the genomic properties of the Verrucomicrobiota included in this study. There was a clear relationship between genome size and gene count, which was to be expected. Genome size varied slightly between orders of Verrucomicrobiota, but dramatically between genera, with JAFAMB01 having the largest genomes. There was also variety in 16s rRNA counts and tRNA counts. Several novel species of Verrucomicrobiota were discovered, with most of them being of the order Chthoniobacterales For their assemblies, there was not a noticeable relationship between scaffold count, bin completeness, and genome size, and a majority of the samples were of medium bin quality.\nAt Niwot Ridge, like the total data set, there was a variety of genome sizes and phyla. The most common phylum was Pseudomonadota, and Verrucomicrobiota was the fourth most common type. Of novel bacteria, most were Actinomycetota with Verrucomicrobiota a close second.\nLooking at the overall data, there was a wide distribution of genome sizes, but a large majority were less than 5 million bases. Novel bacteria were found at all the sites, but the most common place to find novel species was in the combined assemblies. Of these novel bacteria, most were of the phylum Actinomycetota, and Verrucomicrobiota had an intermediate number. These results suggest that sampling NEON sites, including Niwot Ridge, can provide a variety of information and can contribute new genera and species, which is both exciting and useful for scientific work.\n\n\nProject Limitations and Next Steps\nThis project was significantly limited by a lack of available data for both our phylum and, especially, for our site. For example, in our graph comparing soil temperature and pH at Niwot Ridge, there are only 6 points because very few environmental readings were done at our site. We also were unable to explore other factors that would have been of interest, such as chlorophyll concentration, algal bloom, and other soil nutrients such as sulfur (which is especially relevant to Verrucomicrobiota species). Future studies could investigate these factors as well as following environmental trends over time. All of this could increase our understanding of Verrucomicrobiota and other phyla’s roles in different ecosystems."

    "text": "The study provides a comprehensive insight into the different distributions, environmental preferences, and genomic characteristics of Verrucomicrobiota across various ecosystems and some of the studies having a focus on the Niwot Ridge. Studying the Verrucomicrobiota showed a remarkable adaptability to diverse environmental conditions, pH levels, soil depths, and nutrient concentrations. It shows their resilience to different environments and conditions.\nFurthermore, the NEON data from the different sites highlight the correlation between some of the factors that are important in ecological research like the soil pH, temperature, and elevation across other NEON sites, emphasizing the need for specific investigations. Analysis of the data showed patterns in genome size and gene count among others. \nHowever, the study was constricted by the data limitations, particularly the lack of other environmental data for the specific site. The data could then be gathered for future research and investigated for the other environmental factors such as chlorophyll concentrations and in particular, their role in sulfur concentrations, advancing our knowledge of microbial communities and ecosystems functioning properly"
