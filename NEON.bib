	abstract = {Verrucomicrobia are ubiquitous in soil, but members of this bacterial phylum are thought to be present at low frequency in soil, with few studies focusing specifically on verrucomicrobial abundance, diversity, and distribution. Here we used barcoded pyrosequencing to analyze verrucomicrobial communities in surface soils collected across a range of biomes in Antarctica, Europe, and the Americas (112 samples), as well as soils collected from pits dug in a montane coniferous forest (69 samples). Data collected from surface horizons indicate that Verrucomicrobia average 23\% of bacterial sequences, making them far more abundant than had been estimated. We show that this underestimation is likely due to primer bias, as many of the commonly used PCR primers appear to exclude verrucomicrobial 16S rRNA genes during amplification. Verrucomicrobia were detected in 180 out of 181 soils examined, with members of the class Spartobacteria dominating verrucomicrobial communities in nearly all biomes and soil depths. The relative abundance of Verrucomicrobia was highest in grasslands and in subsurface soil horizons, where they were often the dominant bacterial phylum. Although their ecology remains poorly understood, Verrucomicrobia appear to be dominant in many soil bacterial communities across the globe, making additional research on their ecology clearly necessary.},

	abstract = {Marine algae annually sequester petagrams of carbon dioxide into polysaccharides, which are a central metabolic fuel for marine carbon cycling. Diatom microalgae produce sulfated polysaccharides containing methyl pentoses that are challenging to degrade for bacteria compared to other monomers, implicating these sugars as a potential carbon sink. Free-living bacteria occurring in phytoplankton blooms that specialise on consuming microalgal sugars, containing fucose and rhamnose remain unknown. Here, genomic and proteomic data indicate that small, coccoid, free-living Verrucomicrobiota specialise in fucose and rhamnose consumption during spring algal blooms in the North Sea. Verrucomicrobiota cell abundance was coupled with the algae bloom onset and accounted for up to 8\% of the bacterioplankton. Glycoside hydrolases, sulfatases, and bacterial microcompartments, critical proteins for the consumption of fucosylated and sulfated polysaccharides, were actively expressed during consecutive spring bloom events. These specialised pathways were assigned to novel and discrete candidate species of the Akkermansiaceae and Puniceicoccaceae families, which we here describe as Candidatus Mariakkermansia forsetii and Candidatus Fucivorax forsetii. Moreover, our results suggest specialised metabolic pathways could determine the fate of complex polysaccharides consumed during algae blooms. Thus the sequestration of phytoplankton organic matter via methyl pentose sugars likely depend on the activity of specialised Verrucomicrobiota populations.},

	abstract = {The Verrucomicrobia phylum of bacteria is widespread in many different ecosystems; however, its role in microbial communities remains poorly understood. Verrucomicrobia are often low-abundance community members, yet previous research suggests they play a major role in organic carbon degradation. While Verrucomicrobia remain poorly represented in culture collections, numerous genomes have been reconstructed from metagenomic data sets in recent years. The study of genomes from across the phylum allows for an extensive assessment of their potential ecosystem roles. The significance of this work is (i) the recovery of a novel genus of Verrucomicrobia from 2.3 km in the subsurface with the ability to withstand the extreme conditions that characterize this environment, and (ii) the most extensive assessment of ecophysiological traits encoded by Verrucomicrobia genomes to date. We show that members of this phylum are specialist organic polymer degraders that can withstand a wider range of environmental conditions than previously thought., Bacteria of the phylum Verrucomicrobia are prevalent and are particularly common in soil and freshwater environments. Their cosmopolitan distribution and reported capacity for polysaccharide degradation suggests members of Verrucomicrobia are important contributors to carbon cycling across Earth’s ecosystems. Despite their prevalence, the Verrucomicrobia are underrepresented in isolate collections and genome databases; consequently, their ecophysiological roles may not be fully realized. Here, we expand genomic sampling of the Verrucomicrobia phylum by describing a novel genus, “Candidatus Marcellius,” belonging to the order Opitutales. “Ca. Marcellius” was recovered from a shale-derived produced fluid metagenome collected 313 days after hydraulic fracturing, the deepest environment from which a member of the Verrucomicrobia has been recovered to date. We uncover genomic attributes that may explain the capacity of this organism to inhabit a shale gas well, including the potential for utilization of organic polymers common in hydraulic fracturing fluids, nitrogen fixation, adaptation to high salinities, and adaptive immunity via CRISPR-Cas. To illuminate the phylogenetic and environmental distribution of these metabolic and adaptive traits across the Verrucomicrobia phylum, we performed a comparative genomic analysis of 31 publicly available, nearly complete Verrucomicrobia genomes. Our genomic findings extend the environmental distribution of the Verrucomicrobia 2.3 kilometers into the terrestrial subsurface. Moreover, we reveal traits widely encoded across members of the Verrucomicrobia, including the capacity to degrade hemicellulose and to adapt to physical and biological environmental perturbations, thereby contributing to the expansive habitat range reported for this phylum., IMPORTANCE The Verrucomicrobia phylum of bacteria is widespread in many different ecosystems; however, its role in microbial communities remains poorly understood.

	abstract = {The trait-based strategies of microorganisms appear to be phylogenetically conserved, but acclimation to climate change may complicate the scenario. To study the roles of phylogeny and environment on bacterial responses to sudden moisture increases, we determine bacterial population-specific growth rates by 18O-DNA quantitative stable isotope probing (18O-qSIP) in soils subjected to a free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) combined with warming. We find that three growth strategies of bacterial taxa – rapid, intermediate and slow responders, defined by the timing of the peak growth rates – are phylogenetically conserved, even at the sub-phylum level. For example, members of class Bacilli and Sphingobacteriia are mainly rapid responders. Climate regimes, however, modify the growth strategies of over 90\% of species, partly confounding the initial phylogenetic pattern. The growth of rapid bacterial responders is more influenced by phylogeny, whereas the variance for slow responders is primarily explained by environmental conditions. Overall, these results highlight the role of phylogenetic and environmental constraints in understanding and predicting the growth strategies of soil microorganisms under global change scenarios.},
